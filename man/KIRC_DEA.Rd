\description{
A subset of the Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) mRNA-seq data from TCGA, curated for differential expression analysis.
This dataset contains 140 samples (70 tumor and 70 normal) with raw gene expression counts and corresponding TCGA sample IDs.
Tumor samples have IDs containing "01A", while normal samples contain "11A".
Gene symbols start from the very first column and each row corresponds to a TCGA sample. Sample IDs are stored as row names.
