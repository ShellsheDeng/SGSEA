\title{Generate log hazard ratios from a Cox Proportional Hazards Model with optional covariates}
\usage{
getLHR(normalizedData, survTime, survStatus, covariates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{normalizedData}{A data frame containing \strong{normalized gene expression counts}.
Rows represent samples, and columns represent \strong{genes (features)}.}

\item{survTime}{A numeric vector of patient survival times, \strong{matching the rows in \code{normalizedData}}.}

\item{survStatus}{A numeric vector of patient survival status (e.g., 0 = alive, 1 = dead).}

\item{covariates}{An \strong{optional} data frame of additional covariates (e.g., age, gender, treatment group).
Each row must match a sample in \code{normalizedData}, and each column represents a covariate.}
}
\value{
A \strong{named numeric vector} of log hazard ratios (LHRs), where names are gene symbols.
Each LHR represents the effect size of a gene on survival, estimated from its own Cox model.
}
\description{
Computes log hazard ratios (LHR) for each gene in the dataset by fitting separate Cox proportional hazards models.
Users can optionally include additional covariates (e.g., age, gender) in the models.
Data should be filtered and normalized before using this function.
