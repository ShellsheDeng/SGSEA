Description: Perform a survival-based gene set enrichment analysis, the log hazard ratio, by calling the functions from survival and fgsea package, and compare with pathways from Reactome database. Function for extracting human pathways from Reactome database is included.  The package also provides mean-variance model based normalization method from limma package and log fold change calculation from DESeq2 package. The package also includes a data set named KIRC for users to play with it. This data is a subset of KIRC from the version-stamped standardized data sets hosted and maintained by the Broad institute The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) Firehose website (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/).
