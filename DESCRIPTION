Description: Perform a Survival-based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (SGSEA) and the typical case vs. control 
    (or normal vs. tumor) GSEA using functions from the survival and fgsea packages. The gene annotation 
    database included in this package is the Reactome database. The package also provides a mean-variance model 
    based normalization method for raw count data, implemented using the limma package. The log fold change 
    calculation function utilizes functions from the DESeq2 package, eliminating the need to normalize raw count 
    data separately for the typical GSEA method. The package also includes a dataset named "KIRC" to serve as 
    an example of the appropriate input data format. This dataset is a subset of Kidney Renal Clear Cell 
    Carcinoma (KIRC) mRNA-seq data (originally 520 patients with 20,502 genes, version 2016_01_28) from the 
    Broad Institute The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) Firehose website 
    (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org). Users can run 'SGSEA::runExample()' to launch a corresponding SGSEA 
    Shiny app.
